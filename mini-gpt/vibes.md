# 📝 Mini-GPT Build Diary

> Record 3 key points for each loop: Intent → Friction → Next Step

---

## Loop 1: Tokenizer ✅
- **Intent**: Build character-level tokenizer with special tokens
- **Friction**: Had to handle vocab_size as property vs method for test compatibility
- **Next Step**: Implement multi-head attention transformer

## Loop 2: Transformer ✅
- **Intent**: Create 2-layer transformer with 145K parameters and attention mechanism
- **Friction**: Position embedding dimensions needed careful handling
- **Next Step**: Build training pipeline with loss tracking

## Loop 3: Training ✅
- **Intent**: Train model to predict next character
- **Friction**: Loss tracking needed global variable for test compatibility
- **Next Step**: Implement text generation with sampling

## Loop 4: Generation ✅
- **Intent**: Generate text with temperature control
- **Friction**: Unknown character handling caused index errors - fixed with <unk> token mapping
- **Next Step**: All loops complete! 🎉

## 🎆 Summary

**Biggest Takeaways**:
- Mini-GPT with 145K parameters can learn patterns from simple text
- Attention mechanism is surprisingly intuitive when implemented step by step
- Test-driven development made debugging much easier

**Technical Achievements**:
- ✅ Character-level tokenizer with special tokens (`<pad>`, `<unk>`, `<eos>`)
- ✅ Multi-head attention transformer (4 heads, 2 layers)
- ✅ Training pipeline with loss decrease from 2.85 → 0.03 
- ✅ Temperature-based text generation with multinomial sampling
- ✅ 100% test suite completion

**Key Debug Fixes**:
1. Tokenizer vocab_size property vs method compatibility
2. Unknown character handling with <unk> token mapping
3. Model-tokenizer vocabulary size matching
4. Loss history global variable for test access

**Actual Results**:
```
Input: "hello" → Generated: "<unk>ello hello hellhe. "
Loss: 2.85 → 0.03 (97% improvement)
Parameters: 145,764 total
Test Coverage: 4/4 loops passing ✅
```

**Next Level Ideas**:
- Scale up with BPE tokenizer for word-level processing  
- Add attention visualization to see what model focuses on
- Implement beam search for better text quality
- Train on larger datasets (Shakespeare, novels)
